*** In this notepad the steps to be taken in the simulations of a flood model upon FLAME-GPU 
which have been brought to eliminate the chance of failure and abnormal results.
 

1- Initial condition (initial state of variables) needs to be generated, using xmlGen.cpp located in XML_inpGen folder. 
This can be done by manipulating data (using c-syntax) and executing the program. this is usually done by Cygwin terminal 
and command : g++ -std=c++11 xmlGen.cpp -o xmlGen
then, 0.xml file is generated.

2- Copying 0.xml file to iterations folder. which allows the program to read the initial data.

NOTICE : iteration 0 is taken as the first iteration. so, if anyone needs 276th iteration data, they have to look for the data
in 275th iteration. 

3- Function.c needs to be checked. Due to different test cases and different dimensions of the domain, 
DXL and DYL needs to be assigned carefully with respect to the initial condition. TIMESTEP is assigned as a constant so far.
