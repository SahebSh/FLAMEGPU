(04-03-2019), 
Body effect operates upon the height of each person (taken 1.71 cm)

* to use this option, it is a must to change the radius of PedData, so that only the navmap corresponding to the 
location of pedestrian (under they feet) is updated with the heightl. 

Replace the current one with this one: 

<gpu:partitioningSpatial>
        <gpu:radius>0.005</gpu:radius>
        <gpu:xmin>-1.0</gpu:xmin>
        <gpu:xmax>1.0</gpu:xmax>
        <gpu:ymin>-1.0</gpu:ymin>
        <gpu:ymax>1.0</gpu:ymax>
        <gpu:zmin>0.0</gpu:zmin>
        <gpu:zmax>0.005</gpu:zmax>
   </gpu:partitioningSpatial>

It reduces the number of read messages broadcasted by pedestrians. .

FUTURE PLAN to solve this: 
- The way the drop pont navmap agent is updated by its capacity needs to be changed in a way that suits both
the setup for body effect and without body effect. Doint this will remove the need of changing radiuses. 


----- 
Add the variable 

body_effect_on	
This variable is to switch ‘off’ or ‘on’ the dynamic effect of the pedestrians’ body (as moving objects) 
on the propagating water flows. As this option is yet to develop and test, it is expected to keep it ‘off’ 
during the evacuation simulations. 	

1: turn it on
0: turn it off
